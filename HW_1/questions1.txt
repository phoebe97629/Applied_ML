# Answer the following questions for MNIST assignment

1. What was the difference in final evaluation for each algorithm on this problem?

We can see the Logistic Regression has higher accurate rate. LR reaches 92.55% accuray. The bernulli NB can only reach to 84.13% accuracy. 

2. If you observed a different in evaluation, why do you believe one algorithm performed better than the other?

By observing the confusion matrix, Naive Bays sometime will make some "sever" mistake. For example, it predicts 176 "4" as "9". 
The LR doesn't have that much error. 

3. Based on the confusion matrix, which numerals contributed most to the error, and why?

The number "4". and its always be predicted as 9. I think, naturally, the two figures are very similar, it just 4 has straight line, and 9 has curve. I blieve we can use CNN to explore more about this question.
